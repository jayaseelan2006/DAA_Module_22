# EX 4B DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING â€“ 2
## DATE:
## AIM:
To find the longest string (or strings) that is a substring (or are substrings) of two strings..

## Algorithm
1. Take two strings as input.
2. Create a table to store lengths of matching characters in a row-wise manner.
3. If characters match, increase the value from the diagonal cell by 1; else, put 0.
4. Keep track of the maximum value in the table (this is the length of the longest common substring).
5. Use the max value's position to extract the substring from the original string.  
## Program:

    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    max_len = 0
    end_index = 0

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            if u[i - 1] == v[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                if dp[i][j] > max_len:
                    max_len = dp[i][j]
                    end_index = i
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 0

    return u[end_index - max_len:end_index]

u = input()
v = input()
result = lcw(u, v)
print("The longest common substring is", result)
```

## Result:
Thus the program was executed successfully for finding the longest common substring .
